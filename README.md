# Find Unique Items in an Array

Pretty self explanitory.

Given `[1,1,2,3]` return `[2,3]` if they only occur once.

## Why?

I'm very familiar with the unique items in an array, but items unique to an array was a new concept.

The is more or less to add another algorithm to my toolkit, practice Dynamic Programming, and practice module packaging (Docker, Makefiles, pnpm workspaces).

## Commands

Compile

```bash
pnpm run compile
```

Run tests

```bash
pnpm run test
```

Run examples

```bash
pnpm run examples
```

## TODO

- [ ] Fix up node exports
- [ ] Run package as tarballed node binary
- [ ] Make file
